# Declaration of AI Usage

The use of AI is limited to generating header comments for classes, attributes, and methods through
OpenAI's ChatGPT. To generate the comments, the source code of a class, including its attributes and
methods, along with a brief description of its purpose and functionality, are provided to ChatGPT.
The generated comments are then reviewed and refined to ensure clarity, accuracy, and alignment 
with the courseâ€™s standards before being accepted into the source code.
