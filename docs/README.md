# Mighty Duck User Guide

Mighty Duck is a desktop task management app designed for fast typists. It combines the
efficiency of a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the advantages of a Graphical User Interface
(GUI).

## Data

Mighty Duck's data is automatically saved to the hard disk after any command that modifies the data.
Manual saving is not required.

Advanced users may choose to update the data directly by editing the data file. However, if the
file's format becomes invalid due to these changes, Mighty Duck will discard all data and start with
an empty file upon the next launch. Therefore, it is recommended to back up the file before making
any edits.
